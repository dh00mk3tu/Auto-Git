# Auto-Git
Shell Script to automatically push the code to the Repository so that you don't have to!
Works flawlessly on Linux. 
---
### How To Use
1.  Copy the "auto-git.sh" file to the directory of your project
2. In the .gitignore file, add "auto-git.sh"
3. Execute the command before you start working on your project with the command 

```bash 
./auto-git.sh
```
4. The script will ask you, in what interval do you want to push the code. This means that, if you enter the value '1', the script will push code in every 1 minute.
